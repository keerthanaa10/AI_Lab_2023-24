### DATE: 23/03/2024                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040081
### AIM: 
To write a prolog program to find the answer of query. 
###  Algorithm:
 Step 1: Start the program <br> 
 Step 2: Convert the sentence into First order Logic  <br> 
 Step 3:  Convert the sentence into Horn clause form  <br> 
 Step 4: Add rules and predicates in a program   <br> 
 Step 5:  Pass the query to program. <br> 
 Step 6: Prolog interpreter shows the output and return answer. <br> 
 Step 8:  Stop the program.
### Program:
### Task 1:
Construct the FOL representation for the following sentences <br> 
1.	John likes all kinds of food.  <br> 
2.	Apples are food.  <br> 
3.	Chicken is a food.  <br> 
4.	Sue eats everything Bill eats. <br> 
5.	 Bill eats peanuts  <br> 
   Convert into clause form and Prove that John like Apple by using Prolog. <br> 
### Program:


### Output:
![AI10(1)](https://github.com/keerthanaa10/AI_Lab_2023-24/assets/132996371/6244f803-7499-4602-ba20-6d6e056d7813)

### Task 2:
Consider the following facts and represent them in predicate form: <br>              
1.	Steve likes easy courses. <br> 
2.	Science courses are hard. <br> 
3. All the courses in Have fun department are easy <br> 
4. BK301 is Have fun department course.<br> 
Convert the facts in predicate form to clauses and then prove by resolution: “Steve likes BK301 course”<br> 

### Program:


### Output:
![AI10(2)](https://github.com/keerthanaa10/AI_Lab_2023-24/assets/132996371/f3c37703-3e8b-4575-87a9-e0eb72ff8906)

### Task 3:
Consider the statement <br> 
“This is a crime for an American to sell weapons to hostile nations. The Nano , enemy of America has some missiles and its missiles were sold it by Colonal West who is an American” <br> 
Convert to Clause form and prove west is criminal by using Prolog.<br> 
### Program:


### Output:
![AI10(3)](https://github.com/keerthanaa10/AI_Lab_2023-24/assets/132996371/c84a753f-2d8a-40f7-9edc-626a472fb3f2)

### Result:
Thus the prolog programs were executed successfully and the answer of query was found.
